# ReDeeM: Repository for Deep Learning Models for Mass Spectrometry

ReDeeM is a Rust crate designed for implementing deep learning models specifically tailored for mass spectrometry data. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate the prediction of peptide properties and to develop classifier scoring models (TDA).

<em>[TODO.md spec & Kanban Board](https://bit.ly/3fCwKfM)</em>

### Todo

- [ ] implement learning rate scheduler  
- [ ] implement early stopping during fine-tuning  
- [ ] freeze certain layers for fine-tuning?  
- [ ] xgboost/semi-supervised learning param cleanup  
- [ ] Clean up code / remove comments and unneeded debug macros
